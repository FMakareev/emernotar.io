At the same time the history of changes is preserved, because the blockchain cannot be altered. Also, the record that certifies copyrights can be transferred to another person (to another address).","about_question_8_description":"Our mission is to provide a blockchain service for online digital signing of users' data, timestamping and authorship protection","about_question_9_description":"Watch the video about Emercoin","contact_our_contacts":"Our contacts","contact_ask_a_question":"Ask a question","contact_contacts":"Contacts","contact_navigation_name":"Contacts","contact_submit":"Submit","contact_phone":"Phone","contact_email":"E-mail","contact_address":"Address","contact_form_name":"How can I call you?","contact_form_email":"E-mail","contact_form_theme":"Subject","contact_form_message":"Message","contact_page_title":"Contacts","contact_error_required":"Required field","help_faq":"FAQ","help_help":"Help","help_navigation_name":"Help","help_page_title":"Help","help_question_1_title":"What does this service do?","help_question_1_description":"Calculates the hash (checksum) of the file and sends it to the blockchain transaction. By fact, this is a digital signing of data","help_question_2_title":"Who needs this service?","help_question_2_description":"This service can be used to protect copyrights: a photographer, a scientist, an inventor, a programmer, a writer, a copywriter, a journalist, a blogger, a businessman. Just add a file with your materials: photo, documents, video, program, business plan. Also with the help of the service it is possible to conclude contracts, each party must sing the same file with the contract. You can also make a petition or vote for something.","help_question_3_title":"What is the hash of the file?","help_question_3_description":"This is a unique \"serial number\" or \"fingerprint\" of your data. Changing, at least one bit in the original file, you will get a completely different hash sum. Thus, having the hash sum in a safe place, you can always check the integrity of your data by matching it with your hash sum.","help_question_4_title":"What guarantees our service?","help_question_4_description":"By signing your files on the blockchain: 1. You can check the integrity of data using the hash-sum that is permanently stored on the blockchain. 2. Timestamp - you can definitely check when was the publication of the transaction on the blockchain. 3. Protect the authorship, because the transaction is associated with the person who paid","help_question_5_title":"What is the \"Validity period\"?","help_question_5_description":"The validity period is the period at which level the user can manage his record in the blockchain. Please note that this has nothing to do with the safety of the notarization. Recording in the locker is stored forever. Service NVS, developed on the platform Emercoin only extends records management capabilities. During this time, you can change the text field \"additional information\", extend the validity period or transfer the record to another user. At the end of this period, any other user can \"pick\" this record, and also start to manage it (but the history of all changes will still remain forever in the blockchain). All functions are not available yet, but we will notify you when you can use them.","help_question_6_title":"How to verify a file?","help_question_6_description":"Add a file you want to verify on the site. If the file is in the blockchain, you will see Name Value Service (NVS) entry. In the Name field there is a hash sum, in the Value field is user's data. If the user did not specify anything in Value, by default there will be a hash sum of the payer's e-mail address.","help_question_7_title":"How to prove authorship?","help_question_7_description":"The authorship is proved by the connection between the payer and the blockchain entry. In fact, the service links the payment through PayPal e-mail to the transaction. By default, the hash sum of the email address is published. But users can open email, and they can add other data to the Value field when they notarize the file. For example, name, phone, URL link.","help_question_8_title":"Is the file stored on the blockchain?","help_question_8_description":"No, take care of your the security of your files. The service does not store files. Only hashes. You cannot restore the file from it.","help_question_9_title":"Who sees my file?","help_question_9_description":"No one, not even us. The hash sum is calculated locally on your PC, and the file never leaves your disk. So, to whom to transfer your file or from whom to save it, you take care of yourself.","help_question_10_title":"Is it possible to determine by the hash sum what the file contains?","help_question_10_description":"No. Impossible","help_question_11_title":"Is it possible to sign the same file twice?","help_question_11_description":"Yes, the index number is added to the hash sum through the colon. When you search, you see all transactions for notarizing this file, starting from the first.","help_question_12_title":"And how is the authorship protected then, if anyone can notarize the file any number of times?","help_question_12_description":"Timestamp. This corresponds to the legal principle of proof of authorship. The one who can prove that he owned it first, he is the author. So, before submitting your materials to anyone or their publication, first sign your file on our service.","help_question_13_title":"How else can legally copyright be protected?","help_question_13_description":"Go to the notary.","home_page_title":"Home","home_motivating_text":"Blockchain protection of files","home_or":"or","home_notarize":"Sing","home_verify":"Verification","home_add_title":"Add","home_add_description":"your file","home_pay_title":"Pay","home_pay_description":"_price dollar with a bank card through PayPal","home_wait_title":"Wait","home_wait_description":"20 min for a confirmation of blockchain transaction","home_answer_title":"Receive","home_answer_description":"certificate of notarizing your file to e-mail","home_nav_title":"Home","home_drugndrop":"Drag'n'drop file here for:","home_navigation_name":"Home","home_copyright":"Emernotar Partnership © 2018","home_network_error":"Sorry, the server is currently unavailable.","home_success":"E-mail had been successfully sent","home_calculation_of_hash_preloader":"Data is being processed, it may take a few minutes.
